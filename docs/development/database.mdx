The development environment uses a Postgres database.  This section describes the database schema and
how you can manipulate your local database for testing purposes.

## Schema

## Backup Database

In development, use the `pg_dump` utility to dump a copy of your database:

```sh
pg_dump -U root -h localhost -d sjaa-db-dev -f `date -I`.sql
```

If you are running with the included Docker configurations, then get a shell in your `postgres_container`, create the backup file,
and copy it using `docker cp`.

```sh
# Get a shell in your postgres container
docker container exec -it postgres_container bash

# Execute the backup in the container
pg_dump -U root -h localhost -d sjaa-db-dev -f `date -I`.sql

# Get a different local shell while still logged into your container
# Replace <filename> with the name of your backup file
docker cp postgres_container:/<filename> .
```

## Restore from backup

```sh
psql -h hostname -U root -d sjaa-db-dev < backup.sql
```

## Load data from SJAA DB

To load data from the Google Sheet formatted SJAA DB of yore, save the Google Sheet as a CSV, and then use the `patch` rake command:

```sh
bin/rake patch PATCH_FILE=db.csv
```
