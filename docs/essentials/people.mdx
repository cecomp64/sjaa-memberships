People and Memberships are the core of this application.  A person is stored as a record
in a `people` table in the database.  People have the following attributes and relations:

A person has...
* One `first_name` and one `last_name`
* An internal `id`
* Associated astrobin data (username, latest image id)
* A `discord_id`
* One or more contact objects that contain:
  * An address
  * An email
  * A phone number
  * An indicator if this is primary contact information or not
* Zero or more interests (such as: "solar system," "astrophotography," etc)
* Zero or one referral (i.e. website, search, school, other)
* Zero or more donations each containing one or more items (or cash)
