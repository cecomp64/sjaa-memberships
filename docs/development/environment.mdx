## Docker

The prefered and supported way to maintain a replicable development environment is with Docker.  Download Docker from their
website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ .  No subscription is required, just choose the free-est options.

Once installed, simply run the following commands from the root source code folder to get started:

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

The first time `docker-compose up` is run, your database will be initialized with random, seed data.  This is a good start
for testing functionality.
